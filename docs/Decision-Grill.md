## DG-001 — Native X Harness draft contract

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §7.2, §16, §23.2, §26; upstream `apps/worker/src/routes/posts.ts`; upstream `apps/worker/src/routes/growth.ts`
- Conflict/gap: X Harness has immediate and scheduled posts, while its growth approval moves a draft directly into the executable schedule; it has no inert native draft.
- Impact: `XPublishingAdapter.createDraft`, approval E2E, deployment boundary.
- Safest current behavior: Store an adapter-owned inert inbox row that has no scheduler/publisher path.
- Needed answer: Should a later X Harness upgrade introduce a native inert draft, should the adapter migrate existing inbox rows or retain its own store?
- Resolution: The adapter-owned inbox is the canonical Phase 1 X Harness draft subsystem. Its `cubelic.x-harness-inert-draft.v1` schema, typed read model, unique idempotency contract, human-only inspection route and fail-closed adapter are tested. Any native upstream replacement requires a new ADR and migration keyed by `draft_id`/`idempotency_key`.

## DG-002 — GAS setlist JSON contract

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §4.2, §22.1, §24.2, §28 Task 1; no GAS sample exists in the workspace.
- Conflict/gap: The specification requires a fixed GAS contract but does not define its payload shape.
- Impact: Setlist ingestion field mapping and production compatibility.
- Safest current behavior: Accept only the documented `cubelic.gas-setlist.v1` fixture contract and reject unknown versions.
- Needed answer: Provide one redacted production GAS payload and the canonical song-master identifiers.
- Resolution: Pending.

## DG-003 — Resolve metadata and watched path

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §7.2, §22.2, §24.2, ADR-006 requirement; no sidecar sample or Resolve path exists in the workspace.
- Conflict/gap: File access and metadata fields cannot be bound to a real export contract.
- Impact: Automatic media discovery and exact ffprobe/sidecar mapping.
- Safest current behavior: Phase 1 accepts explicit media metadata through the validation API, hashes supplied bytes/identifiers, and never scans arbitrary paths.
- Needed answer: Provide a redacted Resolve sidecar plus the allowlisted export root.
- Resolution: Pending.

## DG-004 — Post generation provider

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §7.2, §11, §22.3; no model, provider, prompt authority or retention policy is specified.
- Conflict/gap: “Hermes generates” does not define the Phase 1 generation runtime.
- Impact: Reproducibility, privacy, tone and cost.
- Safest current behavior: Use deterministic, versioned Japanese templates that produce at most three variants and expose all review flags.
- Needed answer: Which model/provider and data-retention policy may be used when generative variants are enabled?
- Resolution: Phase 1 deliberately uses versioned deterministic Japanese templates and persists template/version/variant. A generative provider requires a new reviewed ADR and retention decision in a later phase.

## DG-005 — Proof of human approval

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` P-01, §16.2, §21.2; upstream `apps/worker/src/middleware/auth.ts` grants admin to a shared environment API key.
- Conflict/gap: Existing roles do not prove that an approval request came from a human rather than Hermes.
- Impact: Approval endpoint authorization and the primary safety guarantee.
- Safest current behavior: Require both an admin/editor session and a distinct `X-Human-Approval-Key` matching a server-only secret; Hermes never receives that secret.
- Needed answer: Should production replace the second secret with SSO/WebAuthn and named operator identities?
- Resolution: Phase 1 requires an authenticated admin/editor plus a distinct server-side `X-Human-Approval-Key`; Hermes receives neither credential. Named SSO/WebAuthn remains a production-hardening option.

## DG-006 — X account database identifier

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §27 uses logical id `tubelic_cube`; upstream X Harness stores a generated `x_accounts.id` plus username.
- Conflict/gap: The logical account id is not guaranteed to equal the X Harness row id.
- Impact: Adapter handoff and account isolation.
- Safest current behavior: Resolve through the explicit `X_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID` deployment setting and reject a mismatch.
- Needed answer: Provide the production X Harness row id after account setup.
- Resolution: Production account `tubelic_cube` is mapped to X Harness row id `89f9bfc0-428c-480b-9cb3-9ba1698c30da`. The production Worker configuration binds that exact id and preflight rejects the former setup placeholder.

## DG-007 — X text length semantics

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §24.1 requires a character-length test but does not specify weighted URL/CJK counting.
- Conflict/gap: A plain Unicode code-point count is not X's complete weighted-text algorithm.
- Impact: False accept/reject at the text boundary.
- Safest current behavior: Use the official `twitter-text` parser and keep templates comfortably below its weighted limit.
- Needed answer: Confirm whether to add the official weighted-text library once the final posting surface is enabled.
- Resolution: Phase 1 validates every generated, edited and approved body with `twitter-text@3.1.0` `parseTweet`; Japanese/CJK and URL weights are covered by tests.

## DG-008 — Quality-score inputs

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §13 defines axes and thresholds but not an algorithm or source-of-truth values.
- Conflict/gap: The same content could receive different scores without a scoring rubric.
- Impact: Approval eligibility and test repeatability.
- Safest current behavior: Use a deterministic rubric with bounded axis inputs and persist the breakdown; scores below 80 cannot be approved.
- Needed answer: Approve or revise the Phase 1 rubric after reviewing real drafts.
- Resolution: Phase 1 derives all seven axes from stored event, setlist, content, variant and inspected-media facts. Freshness follows the normative time buckets, media appeal follows the inspected quality score, and every breakdown is persisted. Calibration against production drafts remains a later policy revision, not an unscored default.

## DG-009 — Public LP/GAS event identifier mapping

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §14; the public archive exposes detail routes such as `/setlists/2026-07-14/afterimage-trace/`, but `cubelic-fan.com` labels the archive unofficial and exposes no supplied stable JSON/GAS endpoint.
- Conflict/gap: The visible date/slug route does not define a canonical `event_id` to slug mapping, and it is not authoritative enough to infer one.
- Impact: UTM destination correctness.
- Safest current behavior: Require an explicit HTTPS `base_url` on each content item and reject hand-entered tracked URLs.
- Needed answer: Confirm whether `/setlists/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<slug>/` is the canonical production route and provide the authoritative `event_id` to slug mapping or JSON endpoint.
- Resolution: Pending. `PRODUCTION_LP_MAPPING_VALIDATED` defaults to false and production preflight blocks content ingestion until a human separately attests that the authoritative event-to-LP mapping and LP update state were validated.

## DG-010 — Phase 1 deployment topology

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §7.1, §8, ADR-005 requirement; no Cloudflare account topology or environment list was supplied.
- Conflict/gap: Worker/D1/UI may be one deployment or separate trust zones.
- Impact: CORS, secret placement, rollback and production runbook details.
- Safest current behavior: Keep Planner routes in the existing Worker and approval UI in the existing Next app, with one D1 and no public unauthenticated mutation.
- Needed answer: Confirm staging/production domains and whether the approval UI must be private-network-only.
- Resolution: Keep the existing public fan site at `https://cubelic-fan.com` unchanged. Deploy the operator UI to the separate `https://ops.cubelic-fan.com` origin and protect it with Cloudflare Access. Production Worker CORS permits only that operator origin. Public event/setlist output may be integrated into the fan site later through an explicitly reviewed read-only surface; the X Harness operator application must never replace the fan-site root deployment.

## DG-011 — Runtime projection of strategy YAML

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` P-02, §9, §27; `config/*.yaml`; Cloudflare Worker bundle has no agreed config-loader/deployment pipeline.
- Conflict/gap: Phase 1 rules mirror the safety-critical YAML values in typed code, but the YAML is not dynamically loaded. Editing YAML alone therefore does not change runtime behavior.
- Impact: Content mix, thresholds, account identity and later policy changes could drift from executable rules.
- Safest current behavior: Keep conservative constants in the domain module and require tests/code review for changes; publishing remains disabled independently.
- Needed answer: Choose a build-time validated config compiler or a versioned D1 config promotion flow with rollback.
- Resolution: Phase 1 uses a build-time checked typed projection in `policy.generated.ts`; `pnpm check:config` fails on YAML/code/D1 drift. A mutable D1 promotion flow remains a later-phase option.

## DG-012 — Production metrics source

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §6, §15, §22.4, §23.2; no production X metrics entitlement or analytics credential was supplied.
- Conflict/gap: The Phase 1 adapter preserves the complete metrics shape but currently records unavailable values as `null`.
- Impact: KPI dashboards cannot report real platform values until a read-only source is connected.
- Safest current behavior: Preserve `null` rather than infer zero, and keep metrics collection incapable of X writes.
- Needed answer: Supply the authorized read-only metrics source.
- Resolution: The manual publication mapping is implemented as the audited `cubelic.published-post-mapping.v1` contract. Only handed-off drafts may be mapped; collection rejects unknown post ids, and summaries join metrics to the required content dimensions. Connecting a real read-only metrics provider remains pending on entitlement.

## DG-013 — Canonical song and member masters

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §5, §10, §17, §24.3; the official harvest profile currently lists six display names, while no authoritative stable ids, aliases, active-status export, or canonical song catalog exists in the workspace. The public setlist archive is explicitly unofficial.
- Conflict/gap: Phase 1 can validate that identifiers are present and setlist positions are consistent, but public display names and unofficial setlists cannot prove canonical ids, aliases, activity, or the complete song catalog.
- Impact: `song_unknown`, `member_unknown`, setlist reconciliation and member-focused generation.
- Safest current behavior: Accept only human-approved versioned song/member masters; setlist ingestion rejects unknown, inactive, or title-mismatched songs and never guesses a mapping.
- Needed answer: Approve stable ids, aliases and active status for the six officially listed members, and provide a complete human-approved song master from an authoritative source.
- Resolution: Contract, D1 storage, human-only import and fail-closed song reconciliation are implemented; the actual production catalog export remains pending.

## DG-014 — Atomic state and audit commits

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §20, §23.3, §26; `apps/worker/src/routes/cubelic.ts`
- Conflict/gap: State mutations and their audit inserts currently execute as separate D1 operations. A later audit failure can leave changed state without the required audit record; setlist ingestion also folds several entity changes into one command-level audit event.
- Impact: Forensic completeness, reliable rollback and the Phase 1 audit acceptance criterion.
- Safest current behavior: Keep the system undeployed, preserve append-only audit triggers, and fail production preflight until command-level atomic D1 batches with per-entity audit events and failure-injection tests are implemented.
- Needed answer: Confirm whether command-level D1 batches are the transaction boundary, and approve the per-entity audit action vocabulary for multi-entity commands.
- Resolution: Every CUBΣLIC persistence helper now requires audit input and executes state SQL plus append-only audit SQL in one D1 batch. Multi-row draft and master commands emit per-entity events. A Miniflare failure-injection test proves a rejected audit statement rolls back its paired state mutation. Multi-step HTTP commands may remain partially completed, but every committed step is audited and idempotently recoverable.

## DG-015 — Post-event video category state window

- Status: NON_BLOCKING
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §6.2 says `digest_ready` produces a live digest and requires generation to stop on state mismatch, but does not separately assign `member_focus` and `song_focus` to event states.
- Conflict/gap: Allowing those categories before video preparation is complete could bypass the event-state gate; allowing them after archival could create new event-derived drafts from a closed event.
- Impact: Draft eligibility at generation and final human approval.
- Safest current behavior: In Phase 1, require exactly `digest_ready` for `live_digest`, `member_focus`, and `song_focus`. Revalidate the same rule immediately before handoff. `setlist_flash` remains valid from `setlist_confirmed` onward.
- Needed answer: Decide whether `member_focus` and `song_focus` should also be generated from `archived` events, with a distinct archival template family.
- Resolution: Pending; the fail-closed Phase 1 rule above is implemented until the content policy is approved.

## DG-016 — Production account bootstrap order

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `docs/deployment-checklist.md` “Before staging” requires replacing the production `X_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID` placeholder before deployment; `scripts/preflight-production.mjs` rejects that placeholder; the production D1 database currently contains no application tables or `x_accounts` row; the production Worker does not yet exist.
- Conflict/gap: The required production X Harness row id can only be obtained after account setup, but the documented release gate forbids deploying the Worker needed to perform that setup while the row id is absent.
- Impact: Production D1 initialization, Worker creation, X account OAuth setup, `X_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID`, secret provisioning, and release eligibility.
- Safest current behavior: Keep the production Worker undeployed and the operator UI fail-closed; do not invent an account row or promote staging/redacted credentials as production truth. Independent code, staging validation, DNS, Pages, and Access work may continue.
- Needed answer: Authorize either (a) a separately named, publishing-disabled bootstrap Worker bound to production D1 solely for account setup, followed by deletion after the production row id is captured, or (b) an approved manual import of an existing production `x_accounts` row through a secret-bearing operator channel.
- Resolution: The user approved option (a). On 2026-07-22, the fail-closed bootstrap registered production account `tubelic_cube` as internal id `89f9bfc0-428c-480b-9cb3-9ba1698c30da`, with a redacted audit event. That id is now the production `X_HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID`. The temporary Worker, custom API domain, source entry point, and functional Pages deployment were removed after verification; the undeletable latest Pages branch alias was replaced by an Access-protected, no-store, noindex retirement page.

## DG-017 — Phase 1 release gates versus deferred runtime inputs

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §26 assigns active Hermes Cron/Bridge to Phase 2; DG-002, DG-003 and DG-013 classify real GAS, Resolve and master exports as non-blocking; `scripts/preflight-production.mjs` previously required all of them plus `HERMES_ACCESS_TOKEN` for every Phase 1 infrastructure release.
- Conflict/gap: The production preflight promoted deferred capability inputs into unconditional base-runtime blockers.
- Impact: A publishing-disabled Phase 1 Worker and operator shell could not be released without activating or credentialing deferred integrations.
- Safest current behavior: Keep Hermes runtime and production content ingestion disabled by default; require their credentials and validated real inputs only when their explicit enable flags are true. Independently require safe mode, global publishing disable, human/API separation, production CORS, account mapping and staging smoke for every release.
- Needed answer: Whether to separate content ingestion into finer GAS, member and Resolve capability flags when each production integration is activated.
- Resolution: The user approved separating Phase 1 from Phase 2/deferred inputs. `HERMES_RUNTIME_ENABLED` and `PRODUCTION_CONTENT_INGEST_ENABLED` default to false; preflight conditionally requires `HERMES_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `PRODUCTION_INPUTS_VALIDATED` only when the respective capability is enabled. The operator UI remains in build-time maintenance mode until the production API passes smoke verification.

## DG-018 — Cloudflare release authentication proof

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §21.1 forbids storing Cloudflare tokens in Git; `docs/required-production-inputs.md` required a least-privilege API token; the manual production release is authenticated through Wrangler's encrypted OAuth store and `wrangler whoami` succeeds without exposing a token to the release shell.
- Conflict/gap: Preflight required the raw `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment value even when Wrangler already held a working encrypted credential.
- Impact: Operators were pushed to duplicate a deployment credential into process environment solely to satisfy preflight.
- Safest current behavior: CI uses a least-privilege API token. A manual release may instead set `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_VERIFIED=true` only after `wrangler whoami` succeeds for the intended account; neither path prints or copies the credential.
- Needed answer: None for the current manual Phase 1 release. Replace the broad interactive OAuth grant with a narrower release identity before unattended deployment is enabled.
- Resolution: Production preflight now accepts either a non-empty minimum-length `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` or the explicit post-`wrangler whoami` attestation. The current release remains manual and Hermes cannot access either credential.

## DG-019 — Missing or malformed emergency-stop state

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §20 and the repository safety rules require a missing emergency-stop state to fail closed; migration 018 originally seeded `false` and its triggers treated a missing value as resumed.
- Conflict/gap: An absent or non-canonical flag could allow database mutation even though no operator had explicitly resumed the system.
- Impact: Rights, privacy, approval and incident controls could be bypassed after partial migration, manual damage or malformed state.
- Safest current behavior: New installations start stopped. Application reads and database triggers treat every value except the exact string `false` as stopped.
- Needed answer: None for Phase 1.
- Resolution: Migration 019 recreates every emergency-stop trigger with fail-closed semantics and safely defaults missing or invalid state to stopped. Integration tests cover initial, missing, invalid, resumed and stopped states.

## DG-020 — Variant component of draft idempotency

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` allows up to three variants but its abbreviated idempotency formula omitted `variant`; ADR-001 and the implemented canonical draft contract include it.
- Conflict/gap: Without the variant component, the three approved review candidates for one content/template/media tuple would collide.
- Impact: Valid variants could overwrite or collapse into one draft; retry behavior would be ambiguous.
- Safest current behavior: Hash `account_id + content_id + template_version + variant + media_sha256_or_none`. Keep the variant in the stored, reviewed contract.
- Needed answer: None for Phase 1.
- Resolution: The variant component is an intentional, versioned extension. Retries of the same variant converge, while the maximum three distinct review candidates remain distinct.

## DG-021 — Production input bundle coherence

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `SPEC.md` §22.1–22.2, §24.2–24.3; `packages/schemas/src/validate-production-inputs.mjs`; ADR-006
- Conflict/gap: Individually schema-valid GAS, Resolve, song-master and member-master files could still refer to different events, inconsistent songs, duplicate stable ids, or media bytes outside the declared export root. The authoritative LP update-state mapping remains separately pending under DG-009.
- Impact: A release gate could approve inputs that later fail ingestion, bind metadata to the wrong event, or trust an unrelated/tampered media file.
- Safest current behavior: Treat the six JSON contracts, export root and referenced media as one fail-closed production bundle without logging identifiers, payloads or paths.
- Needed answer: None for Phase 1.
- Resolution: For the supplied local contracts, the production validator requires matching LP-event/LP-approval/GAS/Resolve event ids, an LP approval URL equal to the GAS destination with confirmed update state, matching event details, an ingestible event state, consecutive setlist positions, active canonical song id/title-or-alias matches, unique song/member ids, a realpath-confined media file, and an exact streaming SHA-256 match. Contract tests cover each rejection and one complete accepted bundle.

## DG-022 — Upstream merge availability

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: Upstream PR `Shudesu/x-harness-oss#9` is mergeable but requires an upstream maintainer; the user directed work to continue without relying on that merge.
- Conflict/gap: Treating upstream merge as a release prerequisite would block independent safety work and production operations even though the fork and deployed Cloudflare resources are controlled separately.
- Impact: Release provenance, patch publication, rollback references and future upstream synchronization.
- Safest current behavior: Use the exact commit on `Y-Fukiya/x-harness-oss:agent/cubelic-phase1-release` as the operational source of truth, retain the upstream PR for optional later integration, and never claim that upstream contains the fork changes.
- Needed answer: None for the current Phase 1 operation.
- Resolution: Upstream merge is deferred and is not a Phase 1 operational gate. All releases and checks must record the fork commit SHA until an upstream maintainer merges or supersedes PR #9.

## DG-023 — First-run event authority and publishing-stop separation

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `apps/worker/src/routes/cubelic.ts` requires a complete Event record before setlist/media ingestion; the original handoff listed only GAS, Resolve, song and member contracts; `GLOBAL_PUBLISHING_DISABLED=true` also prevented all safe CUBΣLIC draft mutations and disabled the UI resume control.
- Conflict/gap: The documented input bundle could not create the required event, and a reusable LP-validation boolean was not bound to the current event and destination.
- Impact: Production master/event/media/setlist ingestion, draft generation, operator emergency controls and first-run repeatability.
- Safest current behavior: Require human-approved `lp-event.json` and event-specific LP mapping contracts; validate them coherently with GAS/Resolve; keep both emergency stops active outside a short reviewed operation window; retain compile-time Phase 1 route and inert-adapter boundaries at all times.
- Needed answer: None for Phase 1. A later phase must define a separate reviewed publication-enable ceremony before any executable X adapter exists.
- Resolution: The validator now requires the LP event and event-specific LP approval contracts. Readiness verification requires both emergency stops active. Execution requires a separately attested environment window and exact event confirmation, then opens a server-enforced D1 window bound to that event for at most 30 minutes. Requests for another event and expired/missing windows fail closed. Ingest failure and the first successful inert handoff atomically close the server window and re-engage the D1 stop. The environment stop continues to block every non-metrics write whenever active, exactly as `SPEC.md` requires. Legacy X routes remain compile-time blocked and the adapter remains inert even during the operation window.

## DG-024 — Phase 3 publication authority and normal operating mode

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: User request on 2026-07-23 to enable automatic/immediate X posting, scheduling, production content creation without the current formal input bundle, and continuous operation with the stop disengaged; `SPEC.md` §16.2, §20.2, §23.2, §26; `AGENTS.md` “Non-negotiable Phase 1 boundaries”.
- Conflict/gap: The requested outcome crosses the active Phase 1 milestone, while the normative specification permits no Phase 1 scheduling or publishing and defines only limited automatic scheduling candidates for Phase 3; it does not define a reviewed immediate-publication ceremony, a manual-input authority contract, or the exact always-on rate and incident controls.
- Impact: `XPublishingAdapter`, X credential use, scheduler/Cron, approval routes and UI, audit vocabulary, idempotency, rate limits, emergency-stop semantics, production preflight, incident response, and the release claim all change.
- Safest current behavior: Keep the deployed Phase 1 adapter inert. Prepare a separate, default-disabled Phase 3 boundary in which only a named human may immediately publish an individually approved draft; automation may only schedule a pre-approved template in an allowlisted category; manual UI input becomes production authority only after the same rights/privacy/link validation and human approval as imported data; the emergency-stop mechanism remains available and fail-closed even when normal operation is explicitly resumed.
- Needed answer: Approve this Phase 3 boundary and the public seams to test: (1) human-approved immediate publication, (2) allowlisted pre-approved-template scheduling, (3) human-attested manual production input, and (4) emergency stop/resume with normally resumed operation. Approval changes the active implementation milestone from Phase 1-only to Phase 1 plus a default-disabled Phase 3 capability; production enablement remains a separate reviewed release action.
- Resolution: On 2026-07-23 the user explicitly answered “DG-024を承認します”. The approved public seams are implemented as a default-disabled Phase 3 adapter, human-attested manual authority contract, audited publication-job store, human-only immediate-publication route, allowlisted pre-approved-template scheduling route, fail-closed Cron executor, normally resumed operation mode, and retained environment/database emergency stops. Production enablement remains gated by `PHASE3_RELEASE_APPROVED`, Phase 3 staging smoke, explicit category/template allowlists, migration 020, and a separate reviewed deployment.

## DG-025 — Production X credential requires User Context

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `apps/worker/src/cubelic/adapter.ts` uses the configured X account for `POST /2/tweets`; the 2026-07-23 production ceremony returned `publication_outcome_unknown`; the subsequent read-only `GET /2/users/me` check returned X `Unsupported Authentication` and stated that OAuth 2.0 Application-Only is forbidden; the latest ten account posts contained no matching fixed text.
- Conflict/gap: The production account contains an application-only Bearer Token, while X publishing requires OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 User Context.
- Impact: Immediate publication and scheduled Cron delivery cannot safely call X; every attempt would create an unresolved publication job and risk an unsafe retry.
- Safest current behavior: Keep the production D1 emergency stop active, retain the first job as `publishing` for reconciliation, and never retry automatically. Do not expose or copy credentials through logs or Git.
- Needed answer: Configure the production X account through the approved secret channel with either OAuth 1.0a Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret, or an OAuth 2.0 User Context token authorized for tweet read/write and user read.
- Resolution: On 2026-07-23 the operator stored OAuth 1.0a User Context credentials through macOS Keychain. A secret-free `/2/users/me` verification returned X user `1556917966587166720` (`tubelic_cube`), and production D1 was updated with an append-only `x_account.credentials_updated` audit. After a second explicit human authorization, the unresolved job was marked `failed` with `reconciled_no_matching_post`, the approved draft received a new audited retry idempotency key, and a single new publication job completed as X post `2080209283598487956`. A read-only timeline check confirmed that post ID and the approved fixed-text prefix; X URL normalization explains why the stored timeline text does not exactly equal the original URL-bearing input. The D1 emergency stop was reactivated after the ceremony.

## DG-026 — Publication-outcome reconciliation API

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `apps/worker/src/cubelic/adapter.ts` retains an uncertain delivery as `publishing` and refuses every automatic retry; `docs/incidents/2026-07-23-first-phase3-publication.md` required a manual, audited D1 reconciliation before the approved retry; `docs/incident-response.md` does not define a public reconciliation contract.
- Conflict/gap: The safe runtime behavior correctly prevents duplicate delivery, but no reviewed operator API exists to resolve an outcome-unknown job or issue a new retry identity while the emergency stop remains logically active.
- Impact: Future X timeout recovery requires direct production D1 access, and the intended request schema, evidence threshold, operator authorization, published/not-published outcomes, and audit vocabulary are not yet a stable external contract.
- Safest current behavior: Keep outcome-unknown jobs in `publishing`, keep the D1 emergency stop active, require read-only X reconciliation, and permit no retry until a named human separately authorizes a documented manual repair.
- Needed answer: Approve a named-human-only `POST /api/cubelic/admin/publications/:jobId/reconcile` seam with two explicit outcomes: `not_published` requires at least ten recent posts checked and no post-id/fixed-prefix match, then atomically fails the job and issues a retry idempotency key while the externally visible stop remains active; `published` requires the confirmed X post id and timestamp, then completes the existing job without another X write.
- Resolution: On 2026-07-23 the user explicitly answered “DG-026を承認します”. The approved seam is a named-human-only `POST /api/cubelic/admin/publications/:jobId/reconcile` route. It accepts only `not_published` with at least ten checked posts and explicit no-match evidence, or `published` with a numeric X post id and ISO 8601 publication timestamp normalized to UTC. Migration 021 gives each job one persistent reconciliation record and narrowly permits only the matching reconciliation transition while the D1 emergency-stop value remains `true`; duplicate or incomplete attempts roll back. The operation performs no X write and atomically changes the job, retry identity when applicable, reconciliation record, and append-only audits. The operator UI exposes only this approved POST seam using an incident-recorded job id; it adds no job-listing API, performs no X read/write, and converts operator-entered Asia/Tokyo publication time to UTC.

## DG-027 — Boundary checker rejected the approved Phase 3 release

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: `package.json` makes `scripts/check-phase1-boundaries.mjs` part of the required `pnpm check`; DG-024 and `docs/adr/ADR-009-phase3-publication-boundary.md` authorize an exact-gated Phase 3 environment; `apps/worker/wrangler.toml` contains the reviewed staging and production Phase 3 settings.
- Conflict/gap: The checker still required `GLOBAL_PUBLISHING_DISABLED=true` and `CUBELIC_PHASE3_ENABLED=false` in every environment, so the released configuration could never pass its own required verification.
- Impact: CI and release verification failed even though the runtime configuration matched the approved Phase 3 contract, encouraging operators to skip the full check.
- Safest current behavior: Keep all compile-time legacy-route, MCP, UI and Phase 1 adapter checks unchanged; validate each environment as either strict inert Phase 1 or exact-gated Phase 3.
- Needed answer: None; DG-024 already supplied the governing authority and this change does not create a new runtime seam.
- Resolution: `scripts/lib/check-wrangler-boundaries.mjs` now requires `CUBELIC_SAFE_MODE=true` everywhere. Phase 1 requires an exact disabled flag and environment stop; Phase 3 requires the environment stop disengaged, release approval, verified staging smoke, environment-specific delivery mode, explicit reviewed scheduling policies, and the exact dedicated staging Worker URL for fake delivery. CLI and negative tests cover the released configuration, missing gates, unsafe policy categories and fake-delivery hostname drift. The complete `pnpm check` passes.

## DG-028 — Content-ingestion window and Phase 3 delivery were not mutually exclusive

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: DG-023 requires a short event-bound operation window for production ingestion; DG-024 permits Phase 3 publication when its reviewed gates are active. Both originally used the same D1 emergency-stop row, so temporarily resuming ingestion also made immediate publication and Cron scheduling operational.
- Conflict/gap: Application-level stop checks could block the normal path but could not prevent a concurrent operation-window open and publication claim. An expired window also became inactive without atomically restoring the D1 stop in every Phase 3 request path.
- Impact: A due scheduled post could be delivered during approved content ingestion, the first-run verifier could observe unexpected publication capability, and an expired ingestion window could leave normal Phase 3 operation resumed without a new named-human decision.
- Safest current behavior: Treat any stored operation window, active or awaiting expiry cleanup, as an X-publication stop. Require a valid active D1 stop before opening it, and make window creation and publication-job creation/claim mutually exclusive in D1.
- Needed answer: None. This closes a race between the already approved DG-023 and DG-024 boundaries without adding an external capability or weakening either approval gate.
- Resolution: Migration 022 adds bidirectional D1 triggers: an operation-window row blocks publication-job insert/update, while any `publishing` job blocks operation-window insert/update. Reconciliation remains the only no-X-write exception under its DG-026 transaction. The next CUBΣLIC request or Cron atomically records one expiry audit, restores the exact D1 stop, and deletes the expired window. Phase 3 content-ingestion routes remain event-window-bound, while the already approved manual-draft, review, publish/schedule, and metrics-mapping routes remain normal Phase 3 operations.

## DG-029 — Requested expansion beyond the approved publication boundary

- Status: BLOCKING
- Evidence: User request on 2026-07-23 to make real posting, scheduled/Cron posting, DMs, replies, likes, follows, media posting, external-service integration, content generation without formal source data, and Hermes automation available; `SPEC.md` “Hermes Agent”, “X Harness OSS”, and §26; repository `AGENTS.md` “Non-negotiable Phase 1 boundaries”; DG-024.
- Conflict/gap: The request combines three different classes of capability. Text publication, allowlisted scheduling, and Cron delivery already exist under DG-024 but are stopped by the production D1 emergency stop. Human-attested manual input already exists but does not waive rights, privacy, HTTPS-link, approval, or audit evidence. DMs, replies, likes, follows, engagement automation, and Hermes direct publication are explicitly prohibited. Media delivery and generic external-service access have no approved adapter contract, host allowlist, credential boundary, rights evidence, rate policy, incident procedure, or staging proof.
- Impact: A single broad “enable” switch would bypass named-human approval, turn the emergency stop into a cosmetic control, allow unreviewed network destinations, and grant automation a wider X authority than the specification permits.
- Safest current behavior: Keep the production D1 stop active until a named human opens a bounded operation decision. Continue to permit only individually approved text publication and exact allowlisted template scheduling. Hermes may prepare drafts, validation results, scheduling requests, metrics, and reports, but may not hold the human approval credential or call X directly. Treat missing formal files only through the existing human-attested manual-authority record; never invent authoritative facts or rights.
- Needed answer: For media delivery, approve a separate design covering supported MIME types and size limits, R2 object confinement, rights/privacy revalidation, X upload idempotency and outcome reconciliation, deletion/incident handling, staging-only proof, and a default-disabled production flag. For each external service, supply the exact HTTPS host, API purpose, data classification, minimum credential scope, retention policy, and failure behavior. Enabling DMs, replies, likes, follows, engagement gates, cookie access, or Hermes direct publication requires an explicit normative specification change and cannot be inferred from this aggregate request.
- Resolution: Partially resolved. On 2026-07-23 the user confirmed four public seams: checksum-verified streaming of approved media to dedicated R2 storage, existing human-only immediate and allowlisted scheduling routes attaching that media, Cron delivery of the same approved media set, and a Hermes scheduling tool that cannot approve or immediately publish. ADR-010 and migration 027 implement those seams behind the separate default-disabled `CUBELIC_PHASE3_MEDIA_ENABLED` flag. Hermes still has no direct-X, raw-media-upload, or human-approval credential. DMs, replies, likes, follows, engagement gates, cookie access, and unspecified external services remain prohibited or unapproved and therefore keep this decision `BLOCKING` for the broader aggregate request.

## DG-030 — Human interaction support versus prohibited automation

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: User request on 2026-07-24 to support DMs, replies, likes, and follows; `SPEC.md` P-06, §16.2, §26, and the final checklist; repository `AGENTS.md` “Non-negotiable Phase 1 boundaries”; X Automation Rules updated April 2026 (`https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/x-automation`).
- Conflict/gap: The request does not distinguish a named human’s one-by-one action from automated execution. The current specification disables all four capabilities. X permits automated replies and DMs only after recipient opt-in and with prompt opt-out handling, requires prior written X approval for AI-powered automated replies, prohibits automated likes, and prohibits bulk, aggressive, or indiscriminate automated following/unfollowing.
- Impact: Interaction adapter contracts, OAuth scopes, target and consent evidence, message privacy/retention, opt-out processing, content moderation, rate limits, idempotency and outcome reconciliation, emergency stop, UI authority, audit vocabulary, staging proof, and production release eligibility.
- Safest current behavior: Keep every existing DM/reply/like/follow route compile-time blocked. Prepare no direct-X or Hermes tool. The smallest potentially compliant profile is: (1) named-human-only reply to a specific inbound/mentioned post, one response per interaction; (2) named-human-only DM response in a user-initiated conversation, with no proactive or bulk DM; (3) named-human-only one-by-one like; and (4) named-human-only one-by-one follow/unfollow. Automated likes and automated/bulk follow operations remain out of scope. Automated replies/DMs require a later opt-in/opt-out contract and, for AI replies, written X approval evidence.
- Needed answer: Approve or reject the named-human-only profile above. If automation is required for replies or DMs, additionally provide the exact opt-in event, opt-out command/flow, retention period, per-user frequency limit, and written X approval evidence for AI-generated replies. Automated likes and automated/bulk follows will not be implemented.
- Resolution: On 2026-07-24 the user answered “はい” to the named-human-only profile and then approved the four public test seams. ADR-011, migration 028, `XHumanInteractionAdapter`, and the five single-operation REST endpoints implement one specific inbound/mentioned post reply, one response to an exact inbound event in a user-initiated DM conversation, one specific like, or one specific follow/unfollow. Each request requires a named human, a ten-minute request/operator-bound HMAC approval proof, target-provenance attestation, emergency-stop clearance, and an idempotent D1 reservation whose audits omit targets and bodies. Unique non-reversible interaction and approval fingerprints prevent a new operation id from reusing the same approval or responding twice to one inbound event. Hermes has no execution route, Cron has no executor, unknown JSON and bulk-shaped requests are rejected, and ambiguous outcomes stop without automatic retry. A dedicated staging-fake smoke mode breaks the first-smoke bootstrap cycle and is prohibited in production. Automated replies, DMs, likes, and follows remain outside this approval. On 2026-07-24 the user delegated the remaining operational choices to the recommended safe defaults. The production interaction capability therefore remains disabled until there is one concrete inbound target, one named operator, one operation-bound approval, and a same-window verification of the required X User Context scope. This is a deliberate operating policy, not an implementation gap.

## DG-031 — Recommended production media, interaction, input, and agent policy

- Status: RESOLVED
- Evidence: User instruction on 2026-07-24 to use the recommended operational judgment for the remaining production decisions; `SPEC.md` §23.2 and §26; ADR-010; ADR-011; `docs/releases/2026-07-24-media-staging-smoke.md`.
- Conflict/gap: The implementation and staging evidence exist, but no concrete production media asset, approved post body, interaction target, formal production input bundle, or least-privilege agent credential was supplied.
- Impact: R2 retention, incident response time, production media and interaction flags, first external write, formal ingestion eligibility, and agent runtime authority.
- Safest current behavior: Configure bounded storage now, but do not turn missing content or authority into a synthetic external action. Keep the D1 stop active and every optional production capability disabled until its exact one-operation evidence exists.
- Needed answer: None. The user authorized the recommended reversible defaults. A later request must still supply the exact media/body or interaction target because those are operation-specific human approvals, not reusable policy choices.
- Resolution: Production R2 objects under `media/` expire after 30 days and incomplete multipart uploads abort after seven days. On a confirmed or suspected rights, privacy, credential, or wrong-media incident, activate both stops and begin quarantine within 15 minutes; verify R2 deletion within one hour while retaining append-only D1 audit records. Production media delivery remains disabled until one real asset has current rights/privacy evidence, checksum and MIME validation, one exact reviewed body, and a named-human publication approval. Named-human reply, DM reply, like, follow, and unfollow remain disabled until one concrete target and same-window X scope verification exist; automated or bulk forms remain prohibited. Formal ingestion continues to require the complete validated input/LP bundle; manual authority may cover a single manually attested item but never fabricates source facts. The agent runtime remains disabled until a dedicated token is provisioned; when enabled it is limited to validation, drafting, reporting, and allowlisted scheduling and receives no human-approval credential, raw-media write, emergency-resume, or direct-X authority.
